# CoreBit

CoreBit is an extensible Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system designed to facilitate secure interactions between personal profiles, external systems, and operations. It allows users to execute workflows consisting of multiple actions (predefined operational units) based on YAML configuration. The system enables the chaining of commands, secure exchange of data, and connection to various services like Bluetooth devices or payment systems.

## Features

- **Workflow Execution**: Define workflows using YAML configuration. Each workflow consists of multiple steps, with each step corresponding to a predefined action.
- **LLM Interoperability**: Perform operations such as LLM handshakes between different systems or connect to external services.
- **Security Levels**: Assign security levels to actions based on the sensitivity of the operation, e.g., connecting to a Bluetooth device vs. performing a payment.
- **LLM Handshake**: Supports a handshake mechanism between actions to validate connections or data exchanges between systems.
- **User Profile-Driven**: Ties operations to personal profiles, which store sensitive information (e.g., keys, secrets) securely.
- **Metrics Tracking**: InfluxDB metrics tracking for operation performance and errors.
- **Database Management**: Integrated with PostgreSQL to manage persistent data, such as workflow history, user profiles, and action results.

```

## Workflow Definition

The workflows in CoreBit are defined using YAML. An example configuration (`config.yaml`) might look like this:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Bluetooth Connection"
  steps:
    - name: "Connect to Bluetooth"
      action: "connect_bluetooth"
      input:
        bluetooth_device: "MySpeaker"
      output:
        connection_status: "connected"
    - name: "LLM Handshake"
      action: "llm_handshake"
      input:
        connection_status: "connected"
      output:
        handshake_result: "success"
```

Each step in the workflow corresponds to a predefined action, and actions have inputs and outputs that can be used in subsequent steps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Ensure Go is installed on your system.
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/corebit.git
cd corebit
```

2. Build and run the project using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will start inside a Docker container, exposing port `8080`.

### Environment Variables

- **POSTGRES_DB**: The name of the PostgreSQL database.
- **POSTGRES_USER**: PostgreSQL username.
- **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**: PostgreSQL password.
- **INFLUXDB_URL**: InfluxDB URL for metrics tracking.
- **INFLUXDB_TOKEN**: InfluxDB access token.

### Example Command

To execute a predefined workflow, you can call the system from the `main.go` file or through an API endpoint (if integrated).

```bash
go run cmd/corebit/main.go
```

## Using the System

### Defining Actions

Actions are predefined operations such as connecting to a Bluetooth device or performing a handshake between LLMs. You can extend the system by adding new actions in the `pkg/actions` package.

### Monitoring Performance

InfluxDB metrics can be viewed to track the execution time of actions, success rates, and failure rates. You can integrate Grafana with InfluxDB to visualize these metrics.

## Infrastructure with Pulumi

CoreBit uses Pulumi to manage its infrastructure. Pulumi allows us to declaratively define and manage cloud resources like PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and networking.

### Prerequisites

- Install the Pulumi CLI:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
